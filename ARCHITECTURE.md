# Valhuntir Platform Architecture

**Status:** Definitive reference for what is built. Not aspirational.
**Last updated:** 2026-05-31

## Invariants

These are structural facts. If a diagram, README, or plan contradicts any of these, the diagram is wrong.

1. **All client-to-server connections use MCP Streamable HTTP.** No client connects via stdio. Stdio is internal only (gateway → backend MCPs).
2. **The gateway runs on the SIFT workstation.** It is not optional — even solo analysts use it (on localhost). It aggregates all SIFT-local MCPs behind one HTTP endpoint.
3. **wintools-mcp runs on a Windows machine.** It is independent of the gateway. The gateway does not manage, proxy, or coordinate with wintools-mcp in any way.
4. **Clients connect to two endpoints at most:** the gateway (for all SIFT tools) and wintools-mcp (for Windows tools). These are separate, unrelated connections.
5. **The case directory is local per examiner.** Each examiner has their own flat case directory on their SIFT machine. forensic-mcp and the vhir CLI both read and write it. Multi-examiner collaboration uses export/merge (not shared filesystem).
6. **Human approval is structural.** Findings stage as DRAFT. Only the vhir CLI (human, interactive, /dev/tty) can move them to APPROVED or REJECTED. The AI cannot approve its own work.
7. **AGENTS.md is the source of truth for forensic rules.** It is LLM-agnostic. Per-client config files (CLAUDE.md) are copies/derivatives, not sources.
8. **forensic-knowledge is a shared data package.** It is a pip-installable YAML package. forensic-mcp, sift-mcp, and wintools-mcp all depend on it. It has no runtime state.

### What each component does

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **sift-gateway** | Aggregates SIFT-local MCPs. Starts each as a stdio subprocess. Exposes all their tools via `/mcp` (Streamable HTTP) and `/api/v1/tools` (REST). API key → examiner identity mapping for multi-user. |
| **forensic-mcp** | Findings, timeline, evidence, TODOs, discipline rules. The investigation state machine. 9 tools + 14 MCP resources (or 23 tools in tools mode for clients without resource support). |
| **case-mcp** | Case lifecycle and status. Init, activate, close, migrate, list cases, case info, evidence summary, timeline summary, findings summary, recent activity, disk usage, export, import, open portal, backup. 15 tools. |
| **report-mcp** | Report generation with data-driven profiles (full, executive, timeline, ioc, findings, status). Aggregates approved findings, IOCs, MITRE mappings, and Zeltser IR Writing guidance. 6 tools. |
| **sift-mcp** | Authenticated, denylist-protected forensic tool execution on Linux/SIFT. Zimmerman suite, Volatility, Sleuth Kit, Hayabusa, etc. FK-enriched response envelopes. 5 core tools, 65+ catalog entries. |
| **forensic-rag-mcp** | Semantic search across Sigma rules, MITRE ATT&CK, Atomic Red Team, Splunk, KAPE, Velociraptor, LOLBAS, GTFOBins. |
| **windows-triage-mcp** | Offline Windows baseline validation. Checks files, processes, services, scheduled tasks, registry, DLLs, pipes against known-good databases. |
| **opencti-mcp** | Read-only threat intelligence from OpenCTI. IOC lookup, threat actor search, malware search, MITRE technique search. 8 tools. |
| **opensearch-mcp** | Evidence indexing and querying at scale. 15 parsers (evtx, EZ tools, Volatility, JSON, CSV, W3C, etc.), 17 MCP tools (search, aggregate, timeline, enrichment). Deterministic content-based dedup, full provenance. Triage baseline and threat intel enrichment run as programmatic post-ingest passes. Optional — not part of the sift-mcp monorepo ([separate repo](https://github.com/AppliedIR/opensearch-mcp)). |
| **wintools-mcp** | Catalog-gated forensic tool execution on Windows. Zimmerman suite, Hayabusa. FK-enriched response envelopes. Denylist blocks dangerous binaries. 7 tools, 31 catalog entries. |
| **vhir CLI** | Human-only actions: approve/reject findings, review case status, manage evidence, generate reports, audit trail queries, case lifecycle (init/close/activate/migrate), execute forensic commands with audit trail, configure examiner identity. Not callable by AI. |
| **sift-common** | Shared internal package. Canonical AuditWriter, operational logging (oplog), CSV/JSON/text output parsers. Used by all SIFT MCPs. |
| **case-dashboard** (Examiner Portal) | 8-tab browser review UI mounted at `/portal/` on the gateway. Tabs: overview, findings (with provenance chain), timeline (with ruler), hosts, accounts, evidence verification, IOCs, TODOs. Keyboard shortcuts, search, resizable sidebar, light/dark theme, auto-refresh, challenge-response commit. |
| **forensic-knowledge** | Shared YAML data package. Tool guidance, artifact knowledge, discipline rules, playbooks, collection checklists. No runtime state. |

## Enforcement Layers (sift-mcp tool execution)

sift-mcp's forensic policy (`security.yaml`) is enforced by three additive,
defense-in-depth layers around tool execution. All are env-gated and ship safe:
when disabled, behavior is identical to upstream `security.py`-only enforcement.
Each layer is independent — a command must clear all enabled layers to run.

| Layer | Lives in | Gate | What it does | On violation |
|-------|----------|------|--------------|--------------|
| **0 — Harness hooks** | `sift_mcp/hooks/` | `SIFT_POLICY_ENGINE` | Pre-execution hook installed into the agent harness (Claude Code / OpenCode / Pi). Pipes commands from the harness's *native* shell tool — which bypass `run_command` entirely — through the same OPA engine. Closes the bypass gap. | Exit 2, denial reasons on stderr; fails open if engine unavailable |
| **1 — OPA policy engine** | `sift_mcp/policy/` | `SIFT_POLICY_ENGINE` | `security.yaml` is compiled to Rego (Jinja2 templates) and evaluated by OPA on every `run_command`. Returns a structured decision listing *every* policy that fired. `security.py` still runs alongside (parity-tested). | `PolicyDenialError` with all reasons |
| **2 — bubblewrap sandbox** | `sift_mcp/sandbox/` | `SIFT_SANDBOX` | Wraps each tool in an unprivileged bwrap namespace: evidence read-only (incl. new-file creation in `evidence/`, with an `evidence/extracted/` RW carve-out), network unshared, host PID/IPC hidden, dies with parent. | Kernel `EROFS` on evidence writes; no network |

**Composition.** Layer 0 stops a denied command before it leaves the harness
(even via the agent's own bash tool); Layer 1 decides *whether* a command may
run through `run_command` and returns structured, self-correcting feedback;
Layer 2 guarantees that *whatever* runs cannot mutate evidence or reach the
network. Layers 0 and 1 share `SIFT_POLICY_ENGINE` and the same compiled policy,
so the MCP path and the harness path enforce identically. The Valhuntir CLI
deploys a comparable Claude Code-specific sandbox/hook externally; these layers
live *inside* the sift-mcp execution path so they apply to any MCP client.

## Deployment Topologies

### Solo analyst

One SIFT workstation. The LLM client and vhir CLI both run on SIFT.

```
┌─────────────────────── SIFT Workstation ───────────────────────┐
│                                                                │

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### SIFT + Windows

SIFT workstation + Windows forensic VM. The LLM client and vhir CLI run on SIFT. wintools-mcp runs on the Windows box and accesses the case directory over SMB. The LLM client makes two separate HTTP connections: one to the gateway (SIFT tools) and one to wintools-mcp (Windows tools).

```
┌─────────────────────── SIFT Workstation ───────────────────────┐
│                                                                │

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

│       └──SMB──► Case Directory (on SIFT)                       │
│                                                                │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

LLM Client ──streamable-http──► wintools-mcp :4624
```

### Multi-examiner

Multiple examiners work the same case. Each examiner runs their own full stack (LLM client, vhir CLI, sift-gateway, and all MCPs) on their own SIFT workstation with a local case directory. Collaboration is merge-based: examiners export findings/timeline as JSON and import each other's contributions using last-write-wins dedup.

```
┌─ Examiner 1 — SIFT Workstation ─┐
│ LLM Client + vhir CLI            │
│ sift-gateway :4508 ──► MCPs      │
│ Case Directory (local)            │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
        │
        │  export / merge (JSON files)
        │
┌─ Examiner 2 — SIFT Workstation ─┐
│ LLM Client + vhir CLI            │
│ sift-gateway :4508 ──► MCPs      │
│ Case Directory (local)            │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each examiner's findings and timeline entries include the examiner name in the ID (e.g., `F-alice-001`, `T-bob-003`). The `modified_at` field enables last-write-wins merge semantics.

---

## Case Directory Structure

Flat layout. No `examiners/` subdirectory. All data files at case root.

```
cases/INC-2026-0219/
├── CASE.yaml                    # Case metadata (name, status, examiner)
├── evidence/                    # Original evidence (read-only after registration)
├── extractions/                 # Extracted artifacts
├── reports/                     # Generated reports
├── findings.json                # F-alice-001, F-alice-002, ...
├── timeline.json                # T-alice-001, ...
├── todos.json                   # TODO-alice-001, ...
├── iocs.json                    # IOC-alice-001, ... (auto-extracted from findings)
├── evidence.json                # Evidence registry
├── actions.jsonl                # Investigative actions (append-only)
├── evidence_access.jsonl        # Chain-of-custody log
├── approvals.jsonl              # Approval audit trail
└── audit/
    ├── forensic-mcp.jsonl
    ├── sift-mcp.jsonl
    ├── claude-code.jsonl       # PostToolUse hook captures (Claude Code only)
    └── ...
```

ID format includes examiner name: `F-{examiner}-{seq:03d}`, `T-{examiner}-{seq:03d}`, `TODO-{examiner}-{seq:03d}`, `IOC-{examiner}-{seq:03d}`. This makes IDs globally unique across examiners without namespace prefixing.

windows-triage-mcp

```

The gateway uses the low-level MCP `Server` class (not FastMCP) because tools are discovered dynamically from backends at runtime. wintools-mcp uses `FastMCP.streamable_http_app()` because it has statically-registered tools.

Authentication at both endpoints uses ASGI-level wrappers (not Starlette `BaseHTTPMiddleware`) to avoid buffering SSE streams.

---

## Examiner Identity

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. `--examiner` CLI flag
2. `VHIR_EXAMINER` environment variable
3. `~/.vhir/config.yaml` examiner field
4. `VHIR_ANALYST` environment variable (deprecated)
5. OS username (fallback, warns if unconfigured)

The gateway maps API keys to examiner identities in `gateway.yaml`. The examiner name is injected into forensic-mcp tool calls for audit trail attribution.

---

## Client Configuration

`vhir setup client` generates Streamable HTTP configs. All entries use `"type": "streamable-http"`.

```bash
# Solo (gateway on localhost)
vhir setup client --sift=http://127.0.0.1:4508 --client=claude-code -y

# SIFT + Windows
vhir setup client --sift=http://SIFT_IP:4508 --windows=WIN_IP:4624

# Interactive wizard
vhir setup client
```

Generated `.mcp.json` example:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vhir": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:4508/mcp"
    },
    "wintools-mcp": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://192.168.1.20:4624/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
